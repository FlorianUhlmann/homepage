        Florian, AI Developer. <br/>
My roots are in medical physics and software engineering.<br/>
I build AI bots that help people reflect on personal topics â€“ 24/7.<br/>
I work with vector databases, LLMs, transcript analysis, and precise prompt engineering.<br/>
<br/><br/>
My focus is on long-term memory in AI agents.<br/>
I develop systems that understand, remember, and support â€“ an extension to a good coach.<br/>
Currently at Cherrish, I am building personalized agents with a memory layer:<br/>
They assist people in relationships, dating, and family life.<br/>
They create spaces for real connection and personal growth.<br/>
<br/><br/>
My goal: to create AI that builds long-term trust and enables personal development.<br/>
I believe people can learn to use bots consciously and with self-awareness â€“ for themselves and their relationships and finally....for us all.<br/><br/>

In the long run, I see huge potential in prevention, mental health, and relational medicine.<br/>

Iâ€™m Florian â€“ an AI nerd with a heart for humans.<br/>
Technology that strengthens relationships. AI that listens. For a more human future.ðŸš€
